# Work Day Planner

## Description

In this project, I made a webpage that would help an employee plan out their work day. Each text box for each hour is color coded to represent a past, present or future hour. I also included a clear button at the bottom of the page, which will clear the local storage and refresh the page.

I made this webpage from scratch, while using my knowledge of jQuery and Bootstrap, which was completely new for me. I also tried a different approach in terms of color. I included comments in my code to describe how it would work.

Overall, I enjoyed this project. I found it fun to play around with other API's to see how simple tasks could get done in somewhat easier ways. Even though it wasn't required, I included a clear button, which would make it easier for the entire schedule to be clear all at once.
